        The Fermi Paradox is really not much of a paradox at all. The aliens have not visited us simply because they are loathe to leave their gated cosmoses. “I’m afraid to ride the space shuttle,’’ says one indignant extraterrestrial. “You’re constantly afraid that young terrestrials are going to get on and terrorize people - rob, beat them up, even shoot people. Why should ordinary galaxens be endangered just because terrestrials live in bad conditions?’’ this commentator asks, warming to its subject. “Sure, I’m sympathetic, but my sympathy has its limits. If drugs are the main problem, why can’t responsible terrestrials keep drugs under control in their planet?”
