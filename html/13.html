            (click: &quot;survive&quot;)[“Indeed, not only are black and brown people who use drugs more likely to be incarcerated than white drug users, they are also less likely to be seen by healthcare providers and offered addiction treatment, counseling or tools for prevention of overdose and injection related infections. If they do receive medical treatment for opioid dependence, they are more likely than their white counterparts to receive methadone, under DEA surveillance in stigmatized methadone clinics, than to receive buprenorphine, which is pharmacologically similar to methadone but can be prescribed in the privacy of a doctor’s office and taken at home.

            “… to legalize the use of buprenorphine by private doctors required associating it with less stigmatized suburban white populations, and where economic motivations led buprenorphine’s manufacturer to market to insured, employed, largely white clientele. As a result, methadone clinics and office-based buprenorphine have carved out two different clinical spaces for two opioid maintenance therapies: public versus private practices, tightly DEA regulated versus less regulated, symbolically associated with poverty versus affluence, urban versus suburban or rural, and black versus white.”<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121004/pdf/nihms-793451.pdf">1</a></sup>
