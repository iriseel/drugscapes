            In the current opioid crisis, the fall from grace metanarrative is once again being brought out to service its reservation for white victims. It goes without saying that this population naturally inhabits the state of grace known as normalcy. Their stigma regains the Christian connotation of the word, reflecting the sins of the beholders in our blindness to their suffering. They take opioids only to feel normal again, the plea goes, to palliate a deep state of psychical, if not also physical, pain. Substance abuse is self-medication gone awry.

            There is much to be said for the traumatic origins of substance abuse â€” the snarl of early adversity, child abuse that winds towards substance use, poverty that debilitates sobriety, toxic stress accumulating into intoxication, neglect to narcan. But this awareness is already being spread in mainstream news reporting, and so my focus is not on its content but its timing. The same [[appeal-&gt;pitch]] was not made for any of the more pigmented populations affected by the previous waves of opium, marijuana, heroin, or crack consumption in the 1900s, 1930s, 1960s-70s, and 1980s.
