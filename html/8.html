            “Some cohorts, particularly less than college educated whites, have lost faith in the American [[Dream-&gt;trauma theory]], have little hope for the future, and low levels of resilience and coping skills.

In 2015, Ohio officials began signing up inmates for Medicaid so that they could receive addiction treatment after leaving prison. The Ohio Prisons director himself supported the initiative, telling reporters, “I believe it will reduce the number of people returning to prison. Our investment is in communities, not prison. \

Which begs the question — when states began their nine-fold increase on correctional spending in 1985, what was being invested in then? Or rather, whose communities were the prisons an investment for?
