                    llicit drugs take turns standing in for the unknown of various biopolitical subjects, an expression of their latent enmity and anti-American neurobiology — opium for the Chinaman’s fiendishness, marijuana for the Mexican’s madness, cocaine for the negro’s craze. (Note oxycontin’s exceptionalism, where it stands in for the Caucasian’s despair.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These narcotics mark their associated users’ exclusions from prevailing notions of futurity — these people’s conflation with the drugs is seen to reveal, rather than beget, their nonproduction, their idleness, their loitering. They are always the origin of their own downfall. They were never going anywhere, except, god willing, away.

                    Another way to put this is that in practice, mind-altering substances work their spells on only a certain demographic of minds. When it comes to BIPOC, they lose their efficacy and do not alter but merely unsheathe a hereditary “nature.” The fear of mind control and losing one’s mind is the privilege of those who can take their intellect for granted, after all. Even if such a point of view can no longer be espoused in so many words, the practical results of the criminal justice system show that there still is a line, spongy like a buffer zone, between the victim who is extenuated by circumstance, and the &quot;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/01/us/mrs-reagan-assails-drug-users.html">accomplice to murder</a>&quot; who is profiled &quot;<a href="https://nyti.ms/2GAdodI">into prison and throw away the key.</a>&quot;

                  People with a substance use disorder who meet the criteria of skin and suburbia can therefore be limned as hostages to their own biology, whereas those who fail the qualifications remain stuck in the default characterization — inseparable from it.

                In the current opioid crisis, the fall from grace metanarrative is once again being brought out to service its reservation for white victims. It goes without saying that this population naturally inhabits the state of grace known as normalcy. Their stigma regains the Christian connotation of the word, reflecting the sins of the beholders in our blindness to their suffering. They take opioids only to feel normal again, the plea goes, to palliate a deep state of psychical, if not also physical, pain. Substance abuse is self-medication gone awry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                There is much to be said for the traumatic origins of substance abuse — the snarl of early adversity, child abuse that winds towards substance use, poverty that debilitates sobriety, toxic stress accumulating into intoxication, neglect to narcan. But this awareness is already being spread in mainstream news reporting, and so my focus is not on its content but its timing. The same [[appeal-&gt;pitch]] was not made for any of the more pigmented populations affected by the previous waves of opium, marijuana, heroin, or crack consumption in the 1900s, 1930s, 1960s-70s, and 1980s.

                Now, trauma theory itself is only a few decades old and so one can hardly expect use to precede birth, but it descends from a genealogy of choosiness.

                In the late 19th century, most morphine addicts in the U.S. were middle-aged, middle- or upper-class white women. At the time of this majority, “morphinism” was attributed to a condition termed neurasthenia (literally, nervous weakness), which in turn was associated with “brain workers” and a “delicate nervous organization” exclusive to whites. Amidst the constant abrasions of industrial civilization, “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvk12rb0">the unending struggle for professional and social success drained them of what reserves they had.</a>”
                </p>
                <p>
                On the flipside, “ladies of culture” excluded from professionalization also had their own justifications, as one anonymous representative explained:

                    I am the last woman in the world to make excuses for my acts, but you don’t know what morphine means to some of us, many of us, modern women without professions, without beliefs. Morphine makes life possible. It adds to truth a dream. What more does religion do? Perhaps I shock you. What I mean is that truth alone is both not enough and too much for us. Each of us must add to it his or her dream, believe me. I have added mine; <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvk12rb0">I make my life possible by taking morphine.</a>

                “Some cohorts, particularly less than college educated whites, have lost faith in the American Dream, have little hope for the future, and low levels of resilience and coping skills. This is the population that is most vulnerable to opioid overdose and other deaths of despair, while minorities, who still face objective disadvantages and discrimination, are much more hopeful and resilient.” — <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-role-of-despair-in-the-opioid-crisis-lessons-from-the-science-of-well-being/">The Brookings Institution, 2020</a>

                At the same time, when it came to the Chinese opium smoker who immigrated to the U.S. from the 1850s Gold Rush onward, reasoning went in a simpler direction: “Chinaman likee be with Chinaman and smoke opium.” More eloquently, “<a href="https://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/Items/Item108.htm">The Chinaman is a thorn in the side of society — a foreign substance that seems incapable of assimilation and absorption into the body.</a>”

                    In this hierarchy of understanding converge all the usual associations of Caucasians with interiority, psychology, harmlessness, and pain. Complementing these assumptions is a view that, unlike hypersexualized but undersensitive people of color, white Americans are as far removed from sensory pleasure as bandaids. Hence their addiction is pain-relieving rather than pleasure-seeking, a symptom rather than a condition, enriched with all the philosophical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical complexities of a world.

                    The Fermi Paradox is really not much of a paradox at all. The aliens have not visited us simply because they are loathe to leave their gated cosmoses. “I’m afraid to ride the space shuttle,’’ says one indignant extraterrestrial. “You’re constantly afraid that young terrestrials are going to get on and terrorize people - rob, beat them up, even shoot people. Why should ordinary galaxens be endangered just because terrestrials live in bad conditions?’’ this commentator asks, warming to its subject. “Sure, I’m sympathetic, but my sympathy has its limits. If drugs are the main problem, why can’t responsible terrestrials keep drugs under control in their planet?”

                One may accurately point out that in the current opioid crisis, the first wave of addiction and overdose was indeed set off by a pursuit of pain relief shepherded by physicians and pharma. 19th-century matronly morphine addiction was also mostly iatrogenic. Which leads us into another set of questions: Who gets to participate in the culture of medication? Who gets to be prescribed, rather than proscribed, into addiction? Who gets to descend from licit to illicit substance use? Who has access to experts, and therefore is not expected to have known any better?

                Who will be equipped the artillery necessary to ultimately survive the War on Drugs, this “<a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/proclamation-5537-national-drug-abuse-education-and-prevention-week-and-national">battle for liberty from the enslavement of drug addiction</a>”?

                    (click: &quot;survive&quot;)[“Indeed, not only are black and brown people who use drugs more likely to be incarcerated than white drug users, they are also less likely to be seen by healthcare providers and offered addiction treatment, counseling or tools for prevention of overdose and injection related infections. If they do receive medical treatment for opioid dependence, they are more likely than their white counterparts to receive methadone, under DEA surveillance in stigmatized methadone clinics, than to receive buprenorphine, which is pharmacologically similar to methadone but can be prescribed in the privacy of a doctor’s office and taken at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “… to legalize the use of buprenorphine by private doctors required associating it with less stigmatized suburban white populations, and where economic motivations led buprenorphine’s manufacturer to market to insured, employed, largely white clientele. As a result, methadone clinics and office-based buprenorphine have carved out two different clinical spaces for two opioid maintenance therapies: public versus private practices, tightly DEA regulated versus less regulated, symbolically associated with poverty versus affluence, urban versus suburban or rural, and black versus white.”<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121004/pdf/nihms-793451.pdf">1</a></sup>
