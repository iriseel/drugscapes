                    In 2019, an average of 194 people died from drug overdoses per day in the U.S., and among them, 137 involved opioids.<sup><a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-07-16-cdc-drug-overdose-deaths-46-2019#:~:text=Drug%20overdose%20deaths%20in%20the,by%20drug%20category%20and%20state" target="_blank">1</a></sup>

            	<p>The same factors that drive people to illicit substances — mass anxiety, economic crisis, decreased mobility, political instability, isolation, a sense of powerlessness<sup><a href="https://fortune.com/2018/08/11/white-nationalists-economics/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> — are also what drive them to fringe ideologies.<sup><a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-demography-of-the-alt-right" target="_blank">2</a></sup>

                  At a time when overdoses mount and polarization escalates, as increasingly lethal synthetics enter the drug supply and steadily militant conspiracies infiltrate the mediasphere, when the peddlers of dope and misinformation alike lace their products with volatile adulterants of obscure provenance, as we grow inured to our usual doses of clickbait and seek out headlines of increasing potency, when the giving up of self is an epidemic and seems a mass movement …  I sometimes wonder if these are not maladaptive coping mechanisms in different disorientations of destructiveness.

                   Somewhere between substance and idea is sense. Sense of sight, common sense, sense of hearing, good sense, sense of taste, sense of worth, sense of smell, the sense that something is wrong, sense of touch, sense of out of touch. As the world increasingly defies our senses, so swells the lure of intoxication and habit, the giving of meaning and the taking away of the need for it.

                Except, of course, that public health and political science are ultimately not the same thing. White powder is not white power, or even populism, and no liters of bleeding-heart liberalism should drown out that distinction. One is stigmatized, the other stigmatizes; one is criminalized, the other criminalizes; one is disenfranchised, the other self-entitles; one wants to be let live, the other seeks to make die. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further stark differences in substance and ideological disorders abound in terms of their relationships to community, culpability, roleplaying, (false) empowerment, belonging, sense of purpose, and ambition; their diametric relationships to escapism and scapegoating.  Although former white supremacists may compare their shed attachments to lingering addictions,<sup><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/1003_OPSR_TP_Addicted-to-Hate_2017-508.pdf" target="_blank">1</a></sup> perhaps the most direct way to differentiate these two dependencies — both arguably “chronic, relapsing disorders characterized by compulsive behavior despite adverse consequences”<sup><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/drug-misuse-addiction" target="_blank">2</a></sup> — is simply that in one case, the consequences fall mostly on the user; in the other, they fall on the target.

                <p>
                    How about the seesawing between bailouts and austerity? The stock market gets high and overdoses. Then banks and big businesses get narcanned with bailouts, sent out from the ER on their merry tottering way, and can expect to be back in the next four years. All the while, the feeble heart pumps its vital blood, the struggling lungs circulate their essential oxygen, and the mind deepens its doubts.

                    The revolving door here is twofold: while personnel alternate between government and business,<sup><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> people with substance use disorder (SUD) cycle in and out of imprisonment/treatment and discharge, or sobriety/withdrawal and resumption.

                    What syndrome could this be? How many times must we repeat the same mistakes while expecting different results? When will we finally admit we have a problem, and go into treatment? What insurance will cover beyond 14 days of care? How many times will we relapse?

                <p>
                There is a disturbing parallel between the way we talk about community and recovery in addiction and in recession. In addiction, we talk about “tough love” and weigh the benefits of “cutting off” one’s addicted loved one(s), at the same time as we pour tens of billions of dollars into the prison industrial complex and exporting drug wars. In recession, we talk about “toughing it out” and weigh the benefits of cutting off welfare, at the same time as we pour trillions of dollars into corporate bailouts. In both cases, people take (<em>not</em> make) the tough decisions and absorb the costs, while institutions commit the lapses of judgement and collect the profits. Banks were bailed out because we  couldn’t bear the costs of their “hitting rock bottom.” Yet when it comes to individual application, we insist that you have to hit rock bottom before true recovery can begin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                But each bottom lurches lower than the last, and anyways, who’s to say the impact won’t kill you first?

                And here, it becomes obvious that this analogy too has been a forced one, that corporations are not people after all, for    
                <br>
                1) corporations have easier access to lifesaving infusions than people<sup><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/naloxone/index.html?deliveryName=DM8022" target="_blank">1</a></sup>  
                <br>
                2) corporations aren’t charged with felonies and thrown into the prison system<sup><a href="https://ig.ft.com/jailed-bankers/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> for the “probable cause” of having had their lives saved<sup><a href="http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2020/02/18/new_policy_overdose_victims_may_face_charges/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>;
                    <img src="images/greenfield_screenshot.png" style="display:block;text-align:center;margin:auto;padding:1em;">
                3) corporations’ “recklessness and poor judgment” aren’t throttled with mandatory<sup><a href="https://www.wingerdenlaw.com/blog/2020/02/can-you-be-charged-with-drug-possession-if-you-overdose/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> minimums,<sup><a href="https://drugpolicy.org/issues/good-samaritan-fatal-overdose-prevention-laws" target="_blank">5</a></sup> but are instead let go as “not fraud”<sup><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/" target="_blank">6</a></sup>   
                <br>
                4) corporations don’t have their overdoses livestreamed and go viral on facebook<sup><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/09/ohio-police-defends-overdose-photo/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> without even the formality of blurring their faces,<sup><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/americas-heroin-epidemic/year-after-her-overdose-photo-went-viral-mother-now-says-n813451" target="_blank">8</a></sup>  but instead get their dirty laundry sealed and bankers’ names anonymized in out-of-court settlements<sup><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/" target="_blank">9</a></sup>   
                <br>
                5) only corporations have the audacity to sue their first-responders for damages of 40 billion dollars,<sup><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/06/aig-trial-henry-paulson-testimony/16817769/" target="_blank">10</a></sup>  or, right after being resuscitated, to file a suit<sup><a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/aig-settles-lawsuit-for-more-than-400-million-237200.aspx" target="_blank">11</a></sup> challenging the IRS’s decision to disallow their bogus, tax-haven-generated tax credits<sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/aig-settlement/u-s-says-aig-settles-tax-shelter-lawsuit-forgoes-over-400-mln-tax-credits-idUSKBN2782GL" target="_blank">12</a></sup>    
                <br>
                6) only corporations are “offered less punishing terms [for] being bailed out in order to limit the market freefall”<sup><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/06/aig-trial-henry-paulson-testimony/16817769/" target="_blank">13</a></sup> when human freefall is met with forced withdrawal,<sup><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z4jjqw/teenage-girl-left-to-die-of-heroin-withdrawal-in-jail-lawsuit-alleges" target="_blank">14</a></sup> adult diapers, and death in a jail cell<sup><a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2019/apr/2/475-million-settlement-pennsylvania-teenagers-withdrawal-death-jail/" target="_blank">15</a></sup>    
                <br>
                7) only corporations “too big to fail” are recognized as too weak to save themselves and lent a helping hand on their day of reckoning, where people too small to matter are told to just deal with it, get locked up, have their kids taken away by social services, and are banned for life from federal benefits,<sup><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/a-lifetime-of-punishment-the-impact-of-the-felony-drug-ban-on-welfare-benefits/" target="_blank">16</a></sup> even during a pandemic that is killing them RIGHT<sup><a href="https://drugpolicy.org/press-release/2020/08/congress-must-lift-lifetime-felony-drug-ban-snap-and-tanf-during-covid-19" target="_blank">17</a></sup> NOW<sup><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr7916" target="_blank">18</a></sup>    
                <br>
                8) only corporations are neither persecuted nor prosecuted by a “tough-on-crime” policy, but instead have their punishments mitigated by their “systemic importance”<sup><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/house-committee-says-hsbc-wasnt-prosecuted-due-to-too-big-to-jail-fears-2016-07-11" target="_blank">19</a></sup> to the global financial system<sup><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/" target="_blank">20</a></sup>    
                <br>
                9) over and over again, only corporate personhood escapes liquidation where natural personhood is interdicted and indicted, over and over again.
              <p>
                  So no, corporations ultimately are not people, and this seems as good a place to end this false analogy as anywhere else.

                    This country has long espoused a view of the speech-body relationship that is sometimes fantastical, sometimes fanatical, and always hypocritical. On the one hand, we have “Just say no,” a willfully ignorant attachment to performative speech uttering, as though the sounds emitted from the mouth govern a one-to-one relationship with the substances that go in. What sort of magical thinking, or bad math, or double standard, is this, that we can believe that free speech means free bodies, or rather, that the right kind of speech makes for the right kind of body? More than anything else, this slogan shows that its advocate has a lower tolerance for heroin than for people dying.

                    Though really, such a way of thinking comes naturally from the casting of addiction as the simple consequence of a series of bad choices and moral failures.

                    In the face of mounting overdose deaths in this population, media coverage has consolidated a new genre of sorts: the overdose biography. Generally accompanied by a humanizing photo (or multiple), these accounts often go into great depth about the lost loved one's life: their wealth of academic and extracurricular activities, their friends and family, their dreams for the future — and sometimes, their struggles with dysfunctional family, mental illness, and trauma.

                <p>
                    It’s just that, as one study found, there are “no stories of overdose deaths in black and Latino communities, although we know overdose happens in those communities as well. Rather … we found arrest stories. The only details of the individuals involved included name, age, and criminal charge. The individuals in those stories were not afforded particulars about their lives, their families, their hopes and aspirations.”<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121004/pdf/nihms-793451.pdf" target="_blank">2</a></sup>

                    Because of addiction’s intersection between choice and disease,  attitudes towards it are particularly telling about not just what we think about these concepts, but with whom we associate them and how.

                    I will just be blunt. Illicit drugs take turns standing in for the unknown of various biopolitical subjects, an expression of their latent enmity and anti-American neurobiology — opium for the Chinaman’s fiendishness, marijuana for the Mexican’s madness, cocaine for the negro’s craze. (Catch the different tone for oxycontin, where it stands in for the Caucasian’s despair?) These narcotics mark their associated users’ exclusions from prevailing notions of futurity — these people’s conflation with the drugs is seen to reveal, rather than beget, their nonproduction, their idleness, their loitering. They are always the origin of their own downfall. They were never going anywhere, except, god willing, away.<sup><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5494972&page=1" target="_blank">1</a></sup>

                    Another way to put this is that mind-altering substances work their spells on only a certain demographic of minds. When it comes to BIPOC, they lose their efficacy and do not alter but merely unsheathe a hereditary “nature.”

                    In the current opioid crisis, the fall from grace metanarrative is once again being brought out to service its reservation for white victims. It goes without saying that this population naturally inhabits the state of grace known as normalcy. Their stigma regains the Christian connotation of the word, reflecting the sins of the beholders in our blindness to their suffering. They take opioids only to feel normal again, the plea goes, to palliate a deep state of psychical, if not also physical, pain. Substance abuse is self-medication gone awry.

                    You see, even though trauma as a concept is relatively recent, the notion of social abrasion and hardship leading to addiction is not.

                    In the late 19th century, most morphine addicts in the U.S. were middle-aged, middle- or upper-class white women. At the time of this majority, “morphinism” was attributed to a condition termed neurasthenia (literally, nervous weakness), which in turn was associated with “brain workers” and a “delicate nervous organization” exclusive to whites. Amidst the constant abrasions of industrial civilization, “the unending struggle for professional and social success drained them of what reserves they had”<sup><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvk12rb0" target="_blank">1</a></sup> and thereby thrust the thus nervously-depleted towards morphine.

Morphine makes life possible. It adds to truth a dream. What more does religion do? Perhaps I shock you. What I mean is that truth alone is both not enough and too much for us.

                    In 2015, Ohio officials began signing up inmates for Medicaid so that they could receive addiction treatment after leaving prison.

                    But let us return to our 19th-century neurasthenic ladies of culture. Around the same time as these ladies were assuaging their nerves with morphine, Chinese immigrants were arriving in the U.S. for the 1850s Gold Rush. When it came to the Chinese opium smoker, reasoning went in a simpler direction: “Chinaman likee be with Chinaman and smoke opium.”<sup><a href="https://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/Items/Item108.htm" target="_blank">1</a></sup> 
              </p>
                <p>
                    More eloquently, “The Chinaman is a thorn in the side of society — a foreign substance that seems incapable of assimilation and absorption into the body.”<sup><a href="https://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/Items/Item108.htm" target="_blank">2</a></sup>

                <p>
                    No appeals to frayed nerves or an impossible life were made in his defense, even though these “muddy-colored human beings”<sup><a href="https://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/Items/Item108.htm" target="_blank">3</a></sup> mostly came to American shores as solitary indentured laborers; could expect little to no contact with family back home or even women here after the 1875 Page Act banned the immigration of all East Asian women; and performed backbreaking labor in a land that declared them “an absolute alien”<sup><a href="https://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/Items/Item046.htm" target="_blank">4</a></sup> with “no power of assimilation, because he is not a desirable citizen, and because he keeps away those who are desirable citizens.”<sup><a href="https://immigrants.harpweek.com/ChineseAmericans/Items/Item108.htm" target="_blank">5</a></sup>

                    In this hierarchy of understanding converge all the usual associations of Caucasians with interiority, psychology, harmlessness, and pain. Complementing these assumptions is a view that, unlike hypersexualized but undersensitive people of color, white Americans are as far removed from sensory pleasure as bandaids.  Hence their addiction is pain-relieving rather than pleasure-seeking, a symptom rather than a condition, enriched with all the philosophical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical complexities of a world.

The aliens have not visited us simply because they are loathe to leave their gated cosmoses. “I’m afraid to ride the space shuttle,’’ says one indignant extraterrestrial. “You’re constantly afraid that young terrestrials are going to get on and terrorize people - rob, beat them up, even shoot people. Why should ordinary galaxens be endangered just because terrestrials live in bad conditions?’’ this commentator asks, warming to its subject. “Sure, I’m sympathetic, but my sympathy has its limits. If drugs are the main problem, why can’t responsible terrestrials keep drugs under control in their planet?”

                    One may accurately point out that in the current opioid crisis, the first wave of addiction and overdose was indeed set off by a pursuit of pain relief shepherded by physicians and pharma. 19th-century matronly “morphinism” was also mostly iatrogenic. Which leads us into another set of questions: Who gets to participate in the culture of medication? Who gets to be prescribed, rather than proscribed, into addiction? Who gets to descend from licit to illicit substance use? Who has access to experts, and therefore is not expected to have known any better?

                    From opium dens to “negro cocaine fiends” to “Reefer Madness” to the “crack epidemic” to the War on Drugs to now, these tired narratives about addicted and addicting “others” turn out to not be tired out.

                    These ways of thinking and governing are as institutional as they are individual, and so the comparison with the subjective condition of addiction is perhaps not the best fit. But if we were to allow for loose analogies,  and bring back the metaphor of the body politic, then does this too not match the biological processes of addiction, the way in which it rewires the body’s neurological pathways so that even when the “mind” knows, the “body” still craves and goes through the old motions?

                    Now, war.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The toll [of 2015 drug overdoses], as the White House commission on the crisis put it, is the <b style="color:white;">equivalent of the 9/11 attacks</b> every three weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Addiction is at its essence a <b style="color:white;">hijacking</b>. Parts of the brain that are dedicated to rewarding behavior and triggering feelings of satisfaction and calm are <b style="color:white;">kidnapped</b> by opioid drugs to induce a temporary state of ease and even euphoria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Opioids are particularly adept at such <b style="color:white;">snatching and seizing</b>. The body has its own <b style="color:white;">SWAT team</b> that swoops in when pain erupts: receptors on nearly every cell in the body are primed to sound the alarm when you, say, put your hand on a hot stove or stub your toe. Opioid receptors populate cells not just in the body, but in the brain and spinal cord as well. Their job is to tone down the firing pain signals—the fast breathing, the feeling of panic and the excruciating feeling of ouch!—as quickly as possible. Opioid drugs target these receptors and magnify the body’s natural painkilling response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ron still considers getting high every once in a while. But now his <b style="color:white;">thinking brain</b> takes over and quells the urge that rises from the <b style="color:white;">deeper, baser brain</b> that is ruled by the <b style="color:white;">mission</b> to feel good at all costs.”<sup><a href="https://time.com/life-after-opioid-addiction/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not think it a mere coincidence that the language of terrorism and military litter, indeed organize, <em>Time</em>’s description of addiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along this line of thought, in a society that has always taken the metaphor of the body politic literally,  drugs are the biochemical equivalent of terrorists, illegal aliens, and other designated enemies of the state. As opioids cross our porous borders, hijack our brain chemistry, and sabotage our usual reward circuits, our protector-governments ramp up the specter<sup><a href="https://filtermag.org/afghanistan-drug-war/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> of the “narco-terrorist,”<sup><a href="https://filtermag.org/drug-terror-war/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> a menace justifying further militarization.
